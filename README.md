# Auth w/ React
Authoritative login system using <b>ReactJS</b> and <b>NodeJS</b>
<br>My first ever attempt at using popular web frameworks and technologies.

![Example](https://i.imgur.com/9muhbNh.gif)

# Features

* Login username and password authentication
* New user registration if user and e-mail are available and not used
* Visual user feedback through the application

# Issues

This was my first project ever featuring Frontend and Backend logic, so there are problems yet to be solved.

* No auth token
* User data does not persist (no database was used)
